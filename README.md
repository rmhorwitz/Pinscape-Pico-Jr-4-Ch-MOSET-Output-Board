# Pinscape-Pico-Jr-4-Ch-MOSET-Output-Board
The 4 channel MOSFET Output Board is an expansion module for the Pinscape Pico Jr.  The Pinscape Pico Jr is a VP Interface board that allows expandability.  This expansion board uses the DIO Outputs to drive each of the 4 PWM MOSFET amplifiers. This board also requires an external power supply that ranges from 12 to 24V. As mentioned, there are 4 PWM  outputs, each rated at 10 Amp each. In an earlier iteration of this project I attempted to use optocouplers, as this allows electrical isolation of the Pinscape system and the peripheral power system. This isolation reduced electrical shock hazards and damage to the Pinscape circuitry.  It also prevented ground loops, hence common mode noise. However. the optocouplers have inherent performance issues with PWM signal, causing MOSFETs to overheat because of PWM rise/fall time of pulses.  There are several performance optocouplers that have faster rise/fall time performance, but these raise the cost of this project significantly.  Consequently, I have opted to use Michael J Roberts design, as it has superior performance and is a cost effective solution, but sacrifices isolation.  Regardless, most of this design was first created by Michael J Roberts and as such the name Pinscape Pico applies. This repository contains all the fabrication files to create this project.
